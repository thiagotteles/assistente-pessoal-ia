# Rationale
rationale: |
  Story 2.2.4 substantially meets its objectives of providing comprehensive
  documentation for the unified file architecture. The documentation is well-
  structured, contains practical examples, and provides solid foundation for
  future development. While some functional validation gaps exist, they don't
  prevent the documentation from being useful. The quality of content is high
  and examples are practical and well-structured.

  The decision to PASS_WITH_CONCERNS reflects the strong documentation
  foundation while acknowledging minor gaps in end-to-end validation that
  should be addressed in future iterations.
